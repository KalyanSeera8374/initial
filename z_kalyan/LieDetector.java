//Assume that you have built a lie detector which detects the level of chemicals X and Y.
//If the sum of the amounts of X and Y is greater than 30, then the person is telling the truth. 
//Write Java code to take in the values of X and Y and detect whether 
//the person is telling the truth or not.
//If the person is telling the truth, display "The statement said by the person is true".
//If the person is lying then display "The statement said by the person is false".
